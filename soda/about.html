			<h1>About me.</h1>
			<p>Hello. My name is Joey and I design websites, mostly—I like to dabble in other sorts of design too: illustration, branding, and typography. I’m 20 years old (haters) and I’ve been messing around with design since early 2005, but I only started to take it seriously when I was 15 years of age. I’m from a small town in England called Loughborough and I hate it—get me to America please.</p>

			<p>I used to freelance for a company in New Jersey and this is where I learnt shit loads. We was a young team, so it was constant fresh thinking and gave me all the creativity & freedom I needed to pursue as a web designer. However as time went on, I began to take on more business experience and wanted to work more closely with clients, so I took the plunge and started freelancing properly with a selection of clients, I actually ended up making a website for Lego as one of my first big websites, so that was pretty crazy—but so dope.</p>

			<p>Last month (May 2013) I decided I needed to redesign my portfolio and start working towards attracting clients, my only problem was I’d done most of my freelance work under NDA’s, so I lacked work and all I had to show was work I’d created for fun (boredom), I realized I needed to create a site were it shown off my personality and my views on design as a whole. A big blue background and an illustrated avatar is all I come up with—Impressive, I know.</p>

			<p>I’m still learning about design and will always continue to learn. I don’t make websites because its cool and it gets me girls (might do?), I do it because I find the web a beautiful and inspiring place, so to sit and contribute to it and make somebodys business/life grow is so satisfying.</p>

			<p>This isn’t a real biography, I’ve not told you about my amazing basketball skills or my love for sneakers. I just wanted to express my passion for design, working and meeting new people. I love money, but my job is way more important.</p>
